# Fixes Applied - October 5, 2025

## Issue 1: Error Saving Product ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Admin dashboard was showing "Error saving product" when trying to add or edit products.

### Root Cause
- Frontend removed the `image` field from the form
- Backend PHP still expected the `image` field in the INSERT/UPDATE queries
- Mismatch between frontend and backend

### Solution
**Updated `backend/manage_products.php`:**
1. Removed `image` field from INSERT query (POST method)
2. Removed `image` field from UPDATE query (PUT method)
3. Added better success/error responses with `success` flag
4. Now only saves: name, price, category, description

**Updated `admin.js`:**
1. Added better error handling with detailed messages
2. Shows success message when product is saved
3. Shows specific error message if save fails
4. Logs errors to console for debugging

### Result
✅ Products can now be added successfully  
✅ Products can be edited successfully  
✅ Clear success/error messages displayed  
✅ No more "Error saving product" message

## Issue 2: Orders Not Saving to Database ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When customers completed payment, orders were only saved to localStorage but not to the MySQL database. This meant:
- Admin dashboard showed 0 orders
- No revenue data
- No customer purchase history
- Dashboard analytics were empty

### Root Cause
`payment.html` was only saving order data to localStorage and not sending it to the backend PHP server.

### Solution
**Updated `payment.html`:**
1. Changed form submit to `async` function
2. Added `fetch()` call to `backend/checkout.php`
3. Sends order data with customer info and cart items
4. Waits for backend response before proceeding
5. Handles success/error responses properly
6. Updates cart count after successful order
7. Shows error if backend is unavailable

### Order Flow (Now Complete)
```
Customer Cart → Checkout Form → Payment Page
                                      ↓
                              POST to backend/checkout.php
                                      ↓
                              Save to MySQL database:
                              - orders table (customer info)
                              - order_items table (products)
                                      ↓
                              Return order_id
                                      ↓
                              Show confirmation page
```

### Result
✅ Orders now save to MySQL database  
✅ Admin dashboard shows real order data  
✅ Revenue calculations work correctly  
✅ Customer purchase history displays  
✅ Top selling products chart populates  
✅ All analytics work with real data
